            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Versioning control is one main repository for project files. Members of a group check files out, edit them, and then commit them. Version control solves issues with file sharing. Version control systems also, automatically mark who edits a file and when, the difference between the files, and combines the changes to one file. The common repository has all of the newest files, files can’t be overwritten, you can go back to previous version of files and people can work on a file at the same time. Version controlling systems interest me because it provides user’s with the ease and efficiency of doing group work, and other projects without having to worry about things getting messed up or colliding. It is relevant to this class because we are going to be editing files, wanting to revert, merge them, etc.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">git is an open and free foundation spread  version control system. It takes all project sizes with the ease and efficiency desired by user’s. For this VCS each user has their own complete stored version of repository data for their own machine, everything is local, and it avoids any accidental overwrite. I find this topic interesting because, it is an efficient and individual use of a versioning control system. VCS are very interesting programs, and git offers many more different interactions that a remote repository does not. Git is relevant to this class because we are learning to use it on our web applications that we are editing for this assignment, and probably many more to come.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git repositories have many different useful commands. Starting a git repository can be done in two different ways, by taking a local directory and turning it into a git or by cloning and existing one from somewhere else. Both ways give you a git repository on your local machine. Git init command is the command to initialize a repository that is not already under version control. Git clone command is the command used to get an exact copy of basically all the data that serer has. I find these commands interesting because I need to use them more often as I go through the future with this. These commands provide me with the basics of using this local repository. I really enjoy the clone command because I tend to need copies of my work when I mess up or try to add on to previous projects. This is relevant to the class because it is the basics of how to set up the repository we are going to be using.

                <span class="text-muted">More Git advantages</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has many advantages as first mentioned. The way that git uses and stores data is different than other VCS versions. Git actually looks at its data as a picture and saves the state of that project from how it looked; while others use list-like file systems for data. The speed of git is another advantage, due to it being mostly local. Git doesn’t have to look at other computers and networks for information, it is all on the user’s computer, making every action basically instant. Git also has integrity, where everything in git is checked before stored and makes it impossible to alter a file without the repository knowing. One of the advantanges I find especially useful, is git only adds data. Since git only adds data it makes it almost impossible to erase data or make changes that can’t be undone. I find this mostly useful, because there have been countless times where I wished that I could undo something on a project, or wanted to go back to a certain version without losing everything.

                <span class="text-muted">Different VCS</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three different types of version control systems, local, centralized, and distributed. Local VCS provide an easy to use database to keep all file changes under control. This is helpful when people try to copy files to another directory, which seems easy, but usually has many errors such as, overwriting files or writing to the wrong one. Centralized VCS are useful when needing to collaborate with other users, by storing all versions of the file from different servers in one central location. This provides the advantage of everyone knowing what each other is doing on the project. Distributed VCS provide more than just the snapshots of previous files like the centralized VCS. Distributed systems provide a complete copy of the repository, including its entire history. This means everything can be copied back, making it basically a back up system. I find these different systems interesting, because they provide a new world of collaborating with others on projects in a number of different ways, with ease.
